# Video-Editing
This is my attempt on [Devon Crawford Motion Detection algorithm video](https://youtu.be/vNpV9qV0Czg).

I used Opencv2 to sepearate the frames from the video and reattach it later.I also used skimage package to compare between two frames/images.
If you don't have either of those you can install them using pip command below.

`pip install opencv-python scikit-image`

### Future Works/Ideas:

- I also want to add an feature which is featured in [carykh's video](https://youtu.be/DQ8orIurGxw).
- While looking throgh carykh [code](https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter) I noticed a command line tool called [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) which is used to transfer the video into frames and viceversa(various other uses like cropping,etc) so I thinking of migrating to it instead of using CV2.Let's see how it goes
- I want to develop the project while using as minimum packages as possible so might start over once I got implemented some of the features
- I also learnt that so many video editors uses ffmpeg as a subprocess to get the job done for editing and stuff so want to look into it and see where it goes.


And I almost forgot 
##### HELLO There Nice to meet you 
Let us see where this will go shall we :)
